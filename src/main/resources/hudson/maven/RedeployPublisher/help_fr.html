  Deploy artifacts to a Maven repository. In comparison with the standard <code>mvn deploy</code>,
  this feature allows you to deploy artifacts after the entire build is confirmed to be
  successful.

  <p>
  This prevents a typical problem in Maven, where some modules are deployed before
  a critical failure is discovered later down the road, rendering the repository state
  inconsistent.

  <p>
  Note that regardless of this configuration, you can always manually come back
  to Jenkins and deploy any of the past artifacts to any repository of your choice,
  after the fact.

  <p>
  <b>To use this feature you shouldn't deactivate the automatic artifact archiving.</b>
